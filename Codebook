Subject 
     Numerical id for 30 anyonomys subjects, aged between 19-48 years, who conducted 1-2 of 6 possible activities while wearing a Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone to generate data
     
Activity
     Six activities used to generate data on human motion recorded for 2.56 second windows. Some subjects performed two activities. 
          Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying

Measure variables 
The original data set included the following measurements captured by the phone using an embedded accelerometer and gyroscope at a constant rate of 50Hz. Samples were taken over a 2.56 second window with 50% overlap resulting in 128 readings/window. For each window the following vector a features were calculated using variables from time and frequency domains. 

The 't' prefix indidates time while the 'f' prefix indicates frequency. 

tBodyAcc-XYZ
 Time domain of Body Accleration (distance/time^2) in the X, Y and Z directions
tGravityAcc-XYZ
 Time domain of Gravity Acceleration (distance/time^2) in the X, Y and Z directions
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
 Time domain Body Accelerometer Jerk (distance/time^3) in the X, Y and Z directions
tBodyGyro-XYZ
 Time domain Body velocity (distance/time) from the Gyroscope in the X, Y and Z directions
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
 Time domain accleration (distance/time^2) from the Gyroscope in the X, Y and Z directions
tBodyAccMag
 Time domain Body Acceleration Magnitude 
tGravityAccMag
 Time domain Gravity Acceleration Magnitude
tBodyAccJerkMag
 Time domain Accerlerometer Jerk (distance/time^3) Magnitude
tBodyGyroMag
 Time domain Gyroscope Magnitude
tBodyGyroJerkMag
 Time domain Body Gyroscope Jerk (distance/time^3) Magnitude
fBodyAcc-XYZ 
 Frequency domain Body Accerlation (distance/time^2) in the X, Y and Z directions
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
 Frequency domain Body Acclerometer Jerk (distance/time^3) in the X, Y, and Z directions
fBodyGyro-XYZ
 Frequency Gyroscope velocity (distance/time) in the X, Y and Z directions
fBodyAccMag
 Frequency domain Body Acceleration (distance/time^2) Magnitude
fBodyAccJerkMag
 Frequency domain Body Accerlerometer Jerk (distance/time^3) Magnitude
fBodyGyroMag
 Frequency domain Gyroscope Magnitude
fBodyGyroJerkMag
 Frequency domain Gyroscope Jerk (distance/time^3) Magnitude

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals in the original data were:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
 Mean gravitational accerleration
tBodyAccMean
 Mean time domain body accerleration
tBodyAccJerkMean
 Mean Body accelerometer Jerk
tBodyGyroMean
 Mean time domain body gyroscope velocity 
tBodyGyroJerkMean
 Mean time domain body gyroscope jerk

In the course of tidying the data, only those measure variables that included mean and standard deviation measurents were extracted from the raw data. The resulting 79 measure variables include the mean frequency measures as well on the basis the data may be of use in later analysis.
